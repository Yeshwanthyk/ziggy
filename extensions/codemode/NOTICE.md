# OpenCode attribution

The confined tree-walking interpreter design, result/diagnostic shape, `tools` namespace,
and progressive `$codemode.search` surface are adapted from the MIT-licensed
`@opencode-ai/codemode` package at OpenCode commit
`3a31c4ea801915c0b050df4b3842997ea62b6e93`.

This Ziggy package is a smaller independent adaptation. It parses JavaScript with Acorn and
interprets an explicit subset in-process. It does not copy OpenCode's complete interpreter,
TypeScript transpilation, standard library, OpenAPI adapter, or surrounding host integration.

The distributed `dist/index.js` bundles `effect@4.0.0-beta.99` and `acorn@8.15.0`, both under
their MIT licenses, so a Profile-copied Pi package does not resolve Pi's incompatible ambient
Effect module. Third-party license texts are retained in `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`; Ziggy's root
license governs this package.
